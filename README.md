**Work Sans was made in part on the stolen lands of the Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung people of the Kulin nations. I pay my respect to their elders, past, present and future. Sovereignty has never been ceded.**

There will no longer be **desktop specific OTF fonts**: please install the TTF fonts.

Completed in November 2018, with contributions from [CrystalType](https://github.com/crystaltype) (Vietnamese), [Dennis Grauel](https://dennisgrauel.com/) and [Kia Tasbihgou](http://www.kiatas.me/) (production), and [Stephen Nixon](http://www.thundernixon.com/) (for valuable assistance on variable font workflows)


## Introduction ##

<!--### [Download (Source, OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2)](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans/archive/v1.6.zip)-->

A SIL Open Font project titled 'Work Sans'.

Work Sans is a 9 weight typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques — i.e. [Stephenson Blake](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/14444337254/), [Miller & Richard](https://archive.org/stream/printingtypespec00millrich#page/226/mode/2up/) and [Bauerschen Giesserei](https://archive.org/stream/hauptprobeingedr00baue#page/109/mode/1up). The core of the fonts are optimised for on-screen medium-sized text usage (14px-48px) – but still can be used in print well. The fonts at the extreme weights are designed more for display use. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions – for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.

The fonts under **/fonts/static/TTF**, **/fonts/static/WOFF**, **/fonts/static/WOFF2** contain formats for web use. They have been autohinted with ttfautohint.

The fonts under **/fonts/variable** are variable TTF fonts.

This typeface was funded by Google and is distributed by Google Fonts – many thanks to Dave Crossland for the commission.

The project started in June 2014 and the brief was to have a [minimum viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (alpha release with 9 weights) by December 2014. Work Sans was first available on Google fonts in July 2015. Work Sans was updated between 2018–2020 with Italics and an expanded character set.

Please see [sources/README.md](sources/README.md) for build instructions.
